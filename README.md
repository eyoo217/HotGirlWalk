## Welcome to HotGirlWalk!

Travel optimizer for after the pre-game.

HotGirlWalk figures out the best way to travel. Whether it's the bar, the club, the party, HotGirlWalk will help you get there the fastest and most efficient. 

*How it works*
Upon loading the homepage, enter your address and the place you intend to travel to. Click the "Find Route" button and you will see a map with different routes depicting different methods of travel. HotGirlWalk will show you travel options (Uber, Transit, Walking) and will calculate travel distances and total travel time. You will also be able to see an estimate of how much an Uber ride could potentially cost.

**Disclaimer**: This is not actually intended for large scale use, I am running this completely for free and made it just for fun. DO NOT DRINK AND DRIVE! I also am not responsible for any potential results of use of my application.

## NOTE: 
The website may take a while to load in due to the nature of Render, in which I am using the free tier. Because the server only wakes up when activity occurs, it may take up to a minute for the map to load. I  kind of do not have money to fund this, and mainly made this for fun to experiment and learn more about JavaScript. However if I do find a way to implement a better back-end host that saves me money and doesn't consume all my time I will implement that in the future.
